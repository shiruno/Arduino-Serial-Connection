This code continuously reads the brightness level from a light sensor. If the brightness exceeds a specified threshold, it makes an LED blink. The blinking can be stopped by sending the command "stop" through the Serial Monitor. The code effectively combines analog input reading, digital output control, and serial communication to create an interactive LED control based on ambient light levels.
